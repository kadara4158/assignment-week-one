# assignment-week-onePart 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
sofware engineering is the application of engineering principles, tools and methods in the developmenat mnd maintainance of high quality softwarew systems.its importsnce in the tecnologicxal injdustry is the fact thatit enables the creation of software systems that improve peoples way of living due to its involvbement or incorp[oration into various fields such as communication, healthcare tranport and other variety oif fields.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a.Agile methodologies-the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s  revolutionized software project management due to its emophasis on adaptability and customer collaboration.
b.Programming languages- the development of programing languages such as c that are used in the develpment and maintainace of software systems.
c. Artificial intelligence-software development has created ground for the rise of artificial intelligence models from machine learning models to automotive systems.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a. Requirements- this is the process of gathering and documenting what the user needs and the system requirements to meet those needs.
b. Design-this is the  process of creating a high- level and detailed design of the software artitecture and user interface.
c. Implimentation- this is the process of righting the code and building the softeware in re gards to the softare design specification.
d. Testing- this is the conduction of tests thgat ensure the sofware meetsthe software standards and quality specifications.
e. Development- thi is the release of the software to the customers.
Maintainance- this is the provision of continuous support, updates,and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
the waterfall method is a mothod that follows a sequential approach that contains differnt stages that follow each other like a waterfall, meaning the complition of one stage is the beginning of another.this is suitable for the development of a new car model sine it follows a well structured process which are divided in phrases that are suitable for the different stages of the car development process. On the other hand, agile mothodology follows a repetitive and incremental mothod which focuses on flexibility, collabotion, and responds to change. This is suitable for a scenario where a company is introducing a new product in the market, due to its flexibility the agile  mmethod is able to create new room for any public respose in regards to the product. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a. A software developer is a perdon who is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
b. A qualioty assurance officer is a person wh o assures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
c. A projesct manager is a person who oversees the plannindg, execution, anddelivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. 
Intergrated development  Environments and Version Control Systems enhances productivity, collaboration, and code quality among developers by providing features tghat enable debugging, version control, code edditing tools and automatic testing capabilities. examples of IDEs are visual studio, IDEA and Intelli J. Example of VCS are Github, GIT smash e.t.c    


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 a. Change of requirements escpecially in the developmental stage which leads to a delay in the project . this cvan be solved through the use of agile mothod due to is flexibility  and priorization of tasks. 
 b. Tight deadlines generates pressure to deliver the project on the sceduled time which can lead to rushed development and poor work quality. this can be solved by effective communication by the involved party(developers and customers) which can enable the assingnent of a desired or easy going schedule



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a. Unit testing is used for testing  individual components or functions of the software
b. Intergration testing is used to ensure that different modules or services work together in the software.
c. Software testing  i usrd to identify the vulnarabilities and ensures the software is protected aganist threats.
d. Acceptance testing is the final testing and ensures that the software is fully funtional, reliable and meets the needs of users and stackeholders.




Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is the crafting of prompts that drive artificial intelligence models to produce answers or react as required by the user.it is important as it helps artificial intelligence models to understandthe content, intent, and nuances in language leadimg to a more natural and human-like responce in tasks. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague; how to cook meat
Correct; hot to cook a well-done and flavourful beef steak meat using tomatoes, onions, garam massala, coriander, and bell pepers only.
the new prompt is more effective as it states the things thats are available to be used and what are the expected results.
